                        <p>The all-new 2020 Explorer has been completely redesigned — inside, outside and under the hood. In addition to new capability enhancing features like rear-wheel drive, there are also two new available trims. Explorer now offers a commanding, no-compromise hybrid as well as the most powerful Explorer to date, the all-new Explorer ST. With 400 horsepower, 415 lb.-ft. of torque and top speed of 143 mph, an ST brings the adventure to you.*
                        *Horsepower and torque ratings based on premium fuel per SAEJ1349 standard. Your results may vary.</p>
